# Asana Connector for Data Studio

*This is not an official Google product*.

This [Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com) [Connector](https://developers.google.com/datastudio/connector) lets users query
[Asana](https://asana.com/) tasks for specific projects. This Community
Connector uses the [tasks
api](https://asana.com/developers/api-reference/tasks).

I'm not currently maintaining the connector nor the integration with Asana, but you can still try it out in Google Data Studio using Connector ID **AKfycbzT9AbvEMujSov_uABS0E9__4STRlm8lC9E0atzkN0Z** in the Developers section of your [data sources](https://datastudio.google.com/datasources/) page.
